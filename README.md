# Tifff's Donuts üç©

This was my final group project for the Dev Academy Aotearoa bootcamp. I worked in a team with 5 others, and was the agile facilitator for the project. My technical contributions were in the front-end react components in regards to functionality, as well as front-end authentication and website deployment.
